I"@<p><b><strong>Some time ago I stopped having “debates” on social media because I noticed that they were affecting me emotionally when I realised that it was “impossible to make someone understand” my position and receive solid arguments in return, mea culpa, I was asking a lot from</strong> <strong>social media.</strong> <strong>However, this does not mean that I completely disconnected from interactions on social media, I only focus on what can be done in them, interact and spread information and dog memes.</strong> <strong>Always doggo memes.</strong></b></p>
