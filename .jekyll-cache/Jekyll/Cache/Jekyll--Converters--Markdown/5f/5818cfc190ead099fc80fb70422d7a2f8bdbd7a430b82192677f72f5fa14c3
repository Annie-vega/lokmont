I"<p><strong>I recently made a conscious evaluation about my <em>dark past</em> and how I related to the people around me and I ended up concluding that I was a great example of what they call “the toxic one”, this is something that I am not proud of and I am sure that I still have many of those toxic behaviours in my life, but as I do with all aspects of this discovery process and serious thinking, I am trying to improve it with a lot of patience and a lot of self-care, one thing at a time, one day at a time..</strong></p>
