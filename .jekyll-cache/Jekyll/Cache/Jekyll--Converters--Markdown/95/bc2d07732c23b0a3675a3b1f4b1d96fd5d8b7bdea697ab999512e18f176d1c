I"C<p><strong>Some of our most interesting debates with M. are sparked at 6 am, I’m not quite sure what’s the reason behind it but today’s debate was particularly interesting because I ended up admitting quite fast (less than 2 hours) that my arguments and perceptions behind male contraceptives were wrong, no sugar coating, it was just a classic biased and misleading argument and I want to open part of this debate to you so you can also join and include your own arguments and understand a bit better why aren’t men contraceptives fully developed yet. This was also possible thanks to the support of</strong> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maria-munoz-burbano/"><strong>Mar Muñoz</strong></a><strong>, my go-to expert in drug development, debates on pharmaceutical community and reliable research sources.</strong></p>
